# Font Study: Factorial Design Analysis in SAS
SAS-based 2Â³ factorial experiment exploring how font, size, and medium affect reading comprehension.

This repository contains the files and report for a 2Â³ factorial experiment conducted to assess how **font style**, **text size**, and **medium** (paper vs. screen) influence reading comprehension.

## ðŸ§ª Study Overview
- **Design**: Full factorial 2Â³ experiment
- **Tool**: SAS for data analysis and model fitting
- **Key methods**: ANOVA, interaction effects, Box-Cox transformation, diagnostics

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `Group_Project_Report.pdf`: Final annotated report
- `font_study.sas`: SAS code used for data import, modeling, and visualization
- `responses.csv`: Cleaned dataset (simulated if original data cannot be shared)

## ðŸ“Š Highlights
- Found significant two-way interaction effects
- Suggested reading difficulty is affected by combinations of font and size
- Applied Box-Cox transformation for model improvement
